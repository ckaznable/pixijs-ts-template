## Usage

Clone the repository to use it as a starting point for your own Pixi.js experiments and then remove the remote to clear the way for your own git repo usage

The entry point is `src/index.ts` which already has a Pixi.js app initialized.

### Assets

All assets are placed in the `src/assets/` directory and will be available to the app at `assets/`.

### Scripts

* `npm run start` or `yarn start` - start the development server
* `npm run build` or `yarn run build` - build a deployable bundle
